          world of Harry Potter. Select your House and Wizard to take part in an
          epic 1v1 battle.

            Step 1: Select the house you want to fight with, the character
            you'll be able to select after will depend of your house's choice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 2: Pick your favorite wizard between a selection of hundreds of
            characters, and be ready to fight!
          </p>
          <p>
            Step 3: You'll be granted 3 spells in total, one to attack, one to
            heal yourself and one spell to increase your defense points. You can
            use attacks at any time, as well as defense spell but this one can
            be used only once per fight. As for your health spell, you'll be
            able to regenerate a bit of health when your HP goes to 50 and
            bellow, it's also a one time use.
          </p>

            Step 4: Use your spells against your opponent and try to defeat him.
            The first wizard to have his health points to zero will lose the
            fight.
